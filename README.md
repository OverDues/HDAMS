# HDEMS
hello and welcome to my independent study and project, HDEMS.
HDEMS is a management system for reptile, amphibian, fish, and invertebrate (and anythine else that applies tbh) enclosures. 

this management system, combined with the proper hardware, manages your lights, heating, humidity, and anything else you could ever want, introducing significantly more control and more precise upkeep.
